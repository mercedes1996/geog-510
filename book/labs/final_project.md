# Final Project Guidelines

**Congratulations on reaching this milestone!**
By publishing your Python package on PyPI, you’ve already made a valuable contribution to the geospatial open-source community. The final project offers you the opportunity to further develop your package and share it with a broader audience in a professional and impactful way.

---

## 🔧 Project Objectives

Your final project should:

- **Enhance** the functionality and usability of your Python package.
- **Document** your package with clear, accessible, and reproducible resources.
- **Present** your work in a 10–20 minute video that showcases the purpose, features, and use cases of your package.

---

## 📅 Presentation Schedule

Final presentations will take place during lecture on **May 5 and 7**.
Please **submit a shareable link** to your presentation video (hosted on YouTube, Google Drive, or another preferred platform).

## 🌍 Key Components

Your final project must include the following:

### 1. 📝 **Documentation Website**

Create a well-structured and accessible documentation site that includes:

- **Project Overview**

  - A concise explanation of the problem your package addresses.
  - Clearly identify the **target audience** (e.g., researchers, analysts, educators).

- **Installation Guide**

  - Step-by-step installation instructions (e.g., `pip install your-package-name`).
  - Mention any dependencies or system requirements.

- **Usage Examples**

  - Real-world geospatial analysis problems that your package helps solve.
  - Highlight the practicality and flexibility of the package.

- **Interactive Jupyter Notebooks**

  - Include multiple Jupyter notebooks demonstrating different modules.
  - Add a **Google Colab badge** for each notebook for instant access.
  - Ensure notebooks are runnable, well-commented, and serve as learning tools.

- **API Reference**

  - Auto-generate a clean API reference from your docstrings using MkDocs.

### 2. 🎥 **Video Presentation**

Record a **10–20 minute video** that introduces your package, demonstrates its features, and shows how it can be applied to real-world problems.

- Show both technical implementation and use cases
- Use screen recording and clear narration
- Keep it engaging and informative for a broad audience

Upload your video and **submit the link** along with your final project materials.
